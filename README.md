📖 Overview

This project explores the trends, patterns, and underlying factors behind suicide rates in West Bengal, India, from 2001 to 2014. Using official data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the study aims to go beyond raw statistics to uncover the social, economic, and demographic factors that contribute to this public health crisis.

The R script (Suicide_project.R) performs data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to bring insights to life through graphs and figures that support the findings summarized in the accompanying report, WB Story Suicide.pdf.

🧠 Research Motivation

In 2023, an average of 35 people in West Bengal took their own lives each day — a devastating statistic that masks thousands of untold stories.

Our goal was to humanize the data by identifying:
	•	Who is most vulnerable
	•	How social and economic pressures contribute
	•	What long-term patterns suggest about mental health challenges in the state

📊 Data & Analysis

The project analyzes suicide data between 2001 and 2014, focusing on:

1. Overall Trends
	•	Yearly suicide numbers show fluctuating patterns, with several peaks and drops across two decades.
	•	Notable spikes observed around 2010–2011.

2. Gender Comparison
	•	On average, male suicides are twice as high as female suicides.
	•	The data distribution is right-skewed, with high variability (large standard deviations).
	•	Social expectations and economic responsibilities appear as strong contributing factors for male vulnerability.

3. Occupation-Based Analysis
	•	Self-employed individuals and housewives record the highest suicide rates.
	•	These groups often face immense societal and familial pressure.

4. State Comparisons

Rank	State	Total Suicides (2001–2014)
1	Maharashtra	563,462
2	Tamil Nadu	486,324
3	Andhra Pradesh	469,279
4	West Bengal	456,123
5	Karnataka	434,604

West Bengal ranks fourth nationally — highlighting that this is not an isolated issue but part of a larger national crisis.

🧾 Output

The R script generates:
	•	Visualizations showing suicide trends by year, gender, and occupation
	•	Statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation, variance)
	•	Insights that align with the report’s visual figures (Figures 1–4 in the PDF)

⸻

🩺 Key Insights
	•	Economic distress, gender norms, and occupational pressures are major correlates.
	•	The mental health stigma in rural India remains a barrier to intervention.
	•	Awareness initiatives such as school-based counseling and 24/7 helplines are positive steps forward — but policy action is needed to sustain change.
